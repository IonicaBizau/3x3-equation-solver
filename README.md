## :clipboard: Example



```js
// Dependencies
var Solver = require("3x3-equation-solver");

// 3a + b - 5c = 5
// 4a + 2b + 7c = 19
// 5a - 4b + c = 6
console.log(Solver([
    [3,  1, -5, 5 ]
  , [4,  2,  7, 19]
  , [5, -4,  1, 6 ]
], true));
// =>
// { result: [ 2.442231075697211, 1.7569721115537849, 0.8167330677290837 ],

## :memo: Documentation


### `Solver(input, raw)`
Solves the system of equations.

#### Params

- **Array** `input`: An array of arrays containing the coeficients and the results. Example:
   ```js
   [
       3,  1, -5, 5
     , 4,  2,  7, 19
     , 5, -4,  1, 6
   ]
   ```
- **Boolean** `raw`: If it is true, the return value will be an object like described below. Otherwise, the result array will be returned.

#### Return
- **Object|Array** The actual result (if `raw` is not true) or an object containing the following fields:
 - `result` (Array): An array of three values containing the unknown values.
 - `coefficients` (Array): An array of arrays containing the coefficients.
 - `results` (Array): The equation results.
 - `determinant` (Number): The determinant value.
 - `determinants` (Array): The unknown determinants.
 - `solved` (Boolean): If `true`, that means the system has a solution, otherwise.

## :sparkling_heart: Support my projects
I open-source almost everything I can, and I try to reply to everyone needing help using these projects. Obviously,
this takes time. You can integrate and use these projects in your applications *for free*! You can even change the source code and redistribute (even resell it).

However, if you get some profit from this or just want to encourage me to continue creating stuff, there are few ways you can do it:


 - Starring and sharing the projects you like :rocket:
 - [![Buy me a book][badge_amazon]][amazon]—I love books! I will remember you after years if you buy me one. :grin: :book:
 - [![PayPal][badge_paypal]][paypal-donations]—You can make one-time donations via PayPal. I'll probably buy a ~~coffee~~ tea. :tea:
 - [![Support me on Patreon][badge_patreon]][patreon]—Set up a recurring monthly donation and you will get interesting news about what I'm doing (things that I don't share with everyone).
 - **Bitcoin**—You can send me bitcoins at this address (or scanning the code below): `1P9BRsmazNQcuyTxEqveUsnf5CERdq35V6`
